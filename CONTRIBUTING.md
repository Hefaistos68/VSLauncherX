All contributions are welcome, as long as they are in the scope of the project: Providing a launcher for Visual Studio solutions and projects that facilitates management of multiple solutions and/or projects, helps with better recent list management and offers functionality that the Visual Studio executable does not offer out of the box.

Please adhere to the general C# .NET rules and guidelines, use comments and names that make common sense. 
If you are not sure if you should add something to the application, or have an idea and dont know how and where to start, just get in touch and we discuss it.

Submit your PRs and I get back to them asap.
